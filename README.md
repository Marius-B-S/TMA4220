Numerical Solution of Partial Differential Equations Using FEM - Autumn 2024

## Course content:
The course gives an introduction to finite element methods for the numerical solution of partial differential equations. Topics include: Minimization principle, weak formulation, boundary conditions, quadrature, error analysis, stability, convergence, implementation, direct and iterative solution of the resulting algebraic systems of equations, and applications to the Poisson equation and convection-diffusion equation.

## Projects
* Project 1: Implement and discuss a finite element model in both 1D and 2D from scratch using Python and libraries as numpy and scipy
